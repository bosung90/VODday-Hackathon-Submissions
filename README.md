##Vancouver Open Data Day Challenge
*What VODDay Challenge is your project focusing on? (See the [2017 VODday Challenges](https://www.opendatabc.ca/pages/2017-vodday-vancouver-open-data-day#challenges).)*



##Prototype Problem Statement
*A clear statement of the problem your team has identified to address through the project. Use this problem statement as the basis to ideate around. Research and validate the problem to test if it is an issue, or if others are already addressing in. You may need to pivit your problem statement, and ideas around approach depending on what you discover about the issue and resources available.* 

*This will help focus your approach to addressing the challenge.*



##Protoype Summary
